# Adcash test assignment

A small test assignment using Vue 3, Vite, Pinia and Vitest.

A page is needed to help advertisers define a target audience for their advertisements.
Targeting rules would then be used to serve the ads based on those selections.

There is a folder called [example](https://github.com/abdigali1/adcash-test/tree/main/example) at the root folder, where you can see examples of component code and their tests from a previous project. Includes input, radio button, checkbox and button components and their testing examples. Also used Vue 3, Vite and Jest for testing.
